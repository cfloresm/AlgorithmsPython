Simple algorithms showcase developed in python

1. Mergesort
2. Quicksort
3. Insertion sort
4. Fibonacci iterative
5. Fibonacci recursive
6. Fibonacci using formula: Fibonacci of n = ((1+(5^1/2))^n - (1-(5^1/2))^n) / (2n * (5^1/2))
7. Fibonacci using matrix exponentiation.

Instructions to run this project:

1.- First install python in case you didn't before   https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Opent the file 'numbers.sort' located into the '../Algorithms/files' folder and write the numbers you want to manipulate, usign spaces
between each number.
 
3. Enter into to the main project folder and type in the console the next command: python index.py

4. Select an option and enjoy the output.
